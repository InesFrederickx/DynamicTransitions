# DynamicTransitions

This small one-pager about the process of mitosis start off with a preloader. It is a ball that bounces up and down that is self animated. When the page has loaded you can find the 4 phases of mitosis.
When hovered over the images they have a zoom in effect.

To run this project you first type "cd transitions" to go to the transitions folder. Next you type "npm run dev". Now the project should be running on localhost.

I used the framework Vue.js here because this is a small project. For the transitions I strictly used gsap.
